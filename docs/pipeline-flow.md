# AI Automation QA — Pipeline Flow & Architecture

> **Last updated:** February 27, 2026  
> **Active model:** `qwen2.5-coder:7b` via Ollama (localhost:11434)  
> **Entry point:** Web UI at `http://localhost:9500`

---

## Overview

The pipeline is a **LangGraph state machine** with 9 agents chained in sequence.  
Each agent reads from a shared `AgentState` dict, does its work, writes results back, and passes control to the next agent.

Out of 9 agents, **5 call Ollama** (the local LLM) and **4 do not** — they use rule-based logic, file I/O, or subprocess calls instead.

## Agent-by-Agent Explanation

### 1 · IngestionAgent — `agents/ingestion_agent.py`
**No LLM**

**What it does:**  
If the user uploaded a document (PDF, DOCX, XLSX, TXT) alongside the feature description, this agent parses it and extracts structured use-cases, enriching the feature description and suggesting target modules.  

If no document was uploaded (text-only flow), it is a **no-op** — it immediately passes control to the next agent.

**Input → Output:**
- Input: `source_document` path (optional)
- Output: enriched `feature_description`, populated `target_modules`

---

### 2 · PlannerAgent — `agents/planner_agent.py`
**🤖 Ollama Call #1**

**What it does:**  
This is the first brain of the pipeline. It takes the feature description and the SDP ITSM module taxonomy (`config/module_taxonomy.yaml`) and asks the LLM to figure out:
- Which module path(s) the feature belongs to (e.g., `modules/requests/request/`)
- What specific test scenarios should be generated (create, edit, delete, validate, etc.)

**What Ollama is asked:**  
> *"Given this ITSM feature description and the available module taxonomy, produce a JSON test plan: `{ "module/path": [{ "description": ..., "type": ..., "priority": ... }] }`"*

**Input → Output:**
- Input: `feature_description`, `target_modules` (optional hint)
- Output: `test_plan` — a dict mapping each module path to a list of scenario specs

**Why it's critical:**  
Everything downstream depends on this. If the LLM produces an empty or wrong `test_plan`, no code gets generated. This is also the most memory-intensive step — Ollama needs **4.3 GiB RAM** loaded to answer.

---

### 3 · CoverageAgent — `agents/coverage_agent.py`
**No LLM — uses ChromaDB vector search**

**What it does:**  
Before generating code for a scenario, this agent queries the ChromaDB knowledge base (14,637 vectors from 17,101 existing scenarios across 210 modules) to check if a similar test already exists.

- If a scenario is **too similar** to an existing one → it is marked as a duplicate and skipped
- If it is **genuinely new** → it passes through as a coverage gap

This prevents generating redundant tests that are already in the codebase.

**Input → Output:**
- Input: `test_plan` from PlannerAgent
- Output: `coverage_gaps` (new scenarios), `duplicate_warnings`, filtered `proposed_scenarios`

---

### 4 · UIScoutAgent — `agents/ui_scout_agent.py`
**🤖 Ollama Call #2 + #3**

**What it does:**  
Before writing any code, the agent uses **Playwright** to open a real browser, navigate to the actual SDP application, and observe the live UI for each target module.

It captures an **accessibility snapshot** (DOM tree of buttons, inputs, labels, and their states) from the real running SDP instance.

**Two Ollama calls are made here:**

- **Call #2 — Scout plan inference:**  
  For modules with no pre-defined navigation plan, asks Ollama:  
  > *"For the module path `modules/requests/request/`, what are the step-by-step UI navigation steps to reach the form?"*

- **Call #3 — DOM annotation:**  
  After Playwright captures the snapshot, asks Ollama:  
  > *"Here is the DOM snapshot of the page. What are the actionable UI observations — which fields are visible, which buttons trigger what, what state changes happen?"*

**Input → Output:**
- Input: `proposed_scenarios` (to know which modules to scout)
- Output: `ui_observations` — a dict of `{ module_path: [UIObservation] }` injected into the Coder's prompt

**Why it matters:**  
This gives the CoderAgent live ground truth about the UI instead of relying purely on outdated examples from the knowledge base.

---

### 5 · CoderAgent — `agents/coder_agent.py`
**🤖 Ollama Call #4 (once per module)**

**What it does:**  
This is the primary code generation step. For each module in the `test_plan`, it:

1. **Retrieves RAG context** from ChromaDB — fetches the 3 most similar existing test implementations as examples
2. **Fetches help guide snippets** — field definitions, locator patterns specific to the module
3. **Injects the UI observations** from UIScoutAgent as additional context
4. **Asks Ollama** to generate the Java `@AutomaterScenario` method(s)

**What Ollama is asked:**  
> *"Here are framework rules, similar existing tests, live UI observations, and the scenarios to implement. Generate the Java `@AutomaterScenario` annotated method and the corresponding `Base.java` logic."*

The output must follow a **two-piece format**:
```
// ===== ADD TO: IncidentRequestBase.java =====
<method body>

// ===== ADD TO: IncidentRequest.java =====
<@AutomaterScenario wrapper>
```

**Input → Output:**
- Input: `test_plan`, `ui_observations`
- Output: `generated_code` list — one entry per module with the raw Java code string

---

### 6 · ReviewerAgent — `agents/reviewer_agent.py`
**🤖 Ollama Call #5 (once per module)**

**What it does:**  
Runs in two phases for the generated code:

**Phase A — Static checks (no LLM):**
- Are required imports present (`EntityCase`, `SDPCloudActions`, etc.)?
- Is `@AutomaterScenario` annotation present with required fields?
- Do method signatures match the framework conventions?
- Are data key references valid?

**Phase B — Semantic review (Ollama):**  
> *"Does this code correctly implement the described scenario? Does it follow the framework patterns? Are there logic errors or missing steps?"*

If issues are found, it populates `revision_requests` with specific fix instructions.

**The revision loop:**  
If `revision_requests` is non-empty AND `revision_count < 2`, the pipeline **routes back to CoderAgent** with the fix notes injected into the prompt. This gives the LLM up to 2 chances to self-correct before proceeding regardless.

**Input → Output:**
- Input: `generated_code`
- Output: `review_results`, `revision_requests`

---

### 7 · OutputAgent — `agents/output_agent.py`
**No LLM — file I/O**

**What it does:**  
Parses the two-piece format from CoderAgent's output and writes the Java snippet files to disk under a timestamped run directory:

```
generated/
  <timestamp>_<module_name>/
    IncidentRequestBase_snippet.java
    IncidentRequest_snippet.java
    summary.json
```

Also collects `generation_instructions` — copy-paste-ready terminal commands telling the developer which files to patch in the real project.

**Input → Output:**
- Input: `generated_code`, `review_results`
- Output: `final_output_paths`, `generated_dir`, `generation_instructions`

---

### 8 · RunnerAgent — `agents/runner_agent.py`
**No LLM — Java subprocess**  
**Only activated if `run_config` is provided**

**What it does:**  
Compiles and executes the generated test against the live SDP instance:

1. `javac` targeted compile of just the two patched files
2. Patches `StandaloneDefault.java` with the test class and method
3. Runs `run_test.py` as a subprocess
4. Captures stdout, parses for `$$Failure` / `"successfully"` / exceptions
5. Returns `run_result { success: bool, stdout: str, summary: str }`

**Input → Output:**
- Input: `run_config` (url, email, entity_class, method_name)
- Output: `run_result`

---

### 9 · HealerAgent — `agents/healer_agent.py`
**🤖 Ollama Call #6 + #7**  
**Only activated if RunnerAgent ran AND test failed**

**What it does:**  
Attempts to automatically fix the failing test without human intervention.

**Call #6 — Failure classification:**  
> *"The test output is: `[stdout]`. Is this a LOCATOR failure, API failure, LOGIC failure, or OTHER?"*

**Call #7 — Fix derivation:**
- **LOCATOR failure:** Playwright navigates to the failing page, captures a fresh accessibility snapshot, then asks Ollama:  
  > *"The old XPath `//button[@id='save']` no longer works. Here is the current DOM. What is the correct XPath or `By` locator?"*
- **API / LOGIC failure:** Asks Ollama to generate a code patch based on the error output.

After deriving the fix, Healer patches the Java source, recompiles, and reruns. The result is stored in `heal_result`.

---

### 10 · HgAgent — `agents/hg_agent.py`
**No LLM — VCS operations**  
**Gated by `HG_AGENT_ENABLED` flag (currently `False`)**

**What it does:**  
When enabled, creates a Mercurial branch named after the run and commits all generated files. This gives every auto-generated test its own traceable branch in the SDP source repository.

## External Dependencies

| Service | Role | Used by |
|---------|------|---------|
| **Ollama** `localhost:11434` | Local LLM inference (`qwen2.5-coder:7b`, 4.3 GiB) | Planner, UIScout, Coder, Reviewer, Healer |
| **ChromaDB** `knowledge_base/chroma_db/` | Vector similarity search — 14,637 scenario vectors | Coverage, Coder |
| **Playwright** (Chromium) | Live browser for UI observation and self-healing | UIScout, Healer |
| **SDP Application** `sdpodqa-auto1.csez.zohocorpin.com:9090` | Target app for UI scouting and test execution | UIScout, Runner, Healer |
| **Mercurial** `hg` | Source control for generated tests | HgAgent (gated off) |

---

## Known Constraints

| Constraint | Detail |
|------------|--------|
| **RAM** | Ollama needs 4.3 GiB free to load `qwen2.5-coder:7b`. If available RAM < 4.3 GiB, PlannerAgent fails with OOM and the pipeline produces no output. |
| **Speed** | All inference is CPU-only. A full pipeline run takes **15–25 minutes** on this machine. |
| **Revision cap** | The Reviewer → Coder loop is capped at **2 revisions** to prevent infinite loops. After 2 cycles, whatever code exists is passed to OutputAgent regardless. |
| **Runner opt-in** | RunnerAgent only activates if `run_config` is included in the initial state. The Web UI does not send `run_config` by default — test execution is a separate step. |
| **HgAgent gated** | `HG_AGENT_ENABLED = False` in `config/project_config.py`. Set to `True` to enable auto-branch + commit. |
